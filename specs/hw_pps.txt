DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: Pulsar Positioning System (navigator)
    ID: 0x3c7742c2
    Version: 0x6509
    Manufacturer: 0x982d3e46 (TALON NAVIGATION SYSTEMS)

Description:
    PPS can determine it's position using signals from x-ray pulsars. PPS can
    function in all locations in the Milky Way, but its accuracy will degrade
    exponentially in high velocities and strong gravity fields.

Interrupt behavior:
    When a HWI is received by the PPS, it reads the A register and does one
    of the following actions:
    
    0: GET_SECTOR
       Write current sector number to register B. Numbers with msb set (0x8000)
       are reserved for special codes.
          0x8000       : Unknown sector
          0x8001       : No known pulsars detected
          0x8002       : Equipment malfunction

    1: STORE_COORDINATES
       Reads the B register, and writes the current position data to DCPU-16
       ram starting at address B. Halts the DCPU-16 for 7 cycles.

       The data is encoded as
         INT32: x-coordinate (unit 100m)
         INT32: y-coordinate (unit 100m)
         INT32: z-coordinate (unit 100m)
         UINT16: time synchronization pulse (unit ms)

       Synchronization pulse is 16 bit counter that increments every
       millisecond and resets to zero between every 2^16 seconds.
       All PPS-units simultaneously conclude the same synchronization 
       pulse value regardles of their position or speed.

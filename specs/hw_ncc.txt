"It's alive! Dear lord almighty, it's alive!"

    Name: NCC-1701 (Navigational computer core)
    Version: 1701
    ID: 0x89FE5AE1
    Manufacturer: 0xE142A1FA (Ender innov.)

About: 
    The purpose of this device is to take a major load off the dcpu in the 
    navigational department. This device calculates orbital data and times 
    using imputed orbital state vector data, and using hardware interrupts, can 
    give this processed data to the dcpu so the dcpu can focus on using this 
    data to preform complex automatic orbital maneuvers, basic maneuver 
    calculation, or just plain displaying the data for the user to pilot with. 

INTERRUPT BEHAVIOR:

    When referring to A, B, C, I, J, X, Y, and Z it is referring to registers in 
    the dcpu-16.

    Note: If any of the data points below are equal to 0xFFFF or 0xFFFFFFFF 
    then the data is not available (eccentricity is the exception, 0xFFFF means 
    a hyperbola). 

    Also the binary format for defining an angle in degrees and minutes is: 
    [Caaaaaaaaabbbbbb] b=minutes a=degrees C=sign(if needed)

    When a HWI is received by the NCC, it reads the A register and does one
    of the following actions:

    0 - STORE_ORBITAL_ELEMENTS
        Takes an [ORBITAL_STATE_VECTOR] starting at B and and calculates 
        orbital elements based on gravitational data of the current SOI and 
        returns the following to an 7 word area of ram starting at C. 

        Halts DCPU for 7 cycles.

        Word 0&1 = [INT32] height of apoapsis (100m)
        Word 2&3 = [INT32] height of periapse (100m)
        Word 4 = [SPECIAL] eccentricity in 1/1000 16-bit integer
        Word 5 = [ANGLE] inclination angle
        Word 6 = [ANGLE] Argument of periapse in angular format.

    1 - STORE_SIMULATED_TIMES
        Reads the [ORBITAL_STATE_VECTOR] from memory area starting at B and 
        receives current SOI data directly from Gravity Sensor. Runs the orbit 
        simulation and estimates following orbit parameters:
            - the time in seconds to major nodes of the orbit
            - the current orbital speed 
            - orbital acceleration
        Simulation estimates are stored to a 14 word area of ram starting at C. 

        Note: the amount of cycles it takes this device to simulate an orbit 
        and estimate arrival times is unpredictable as it depends on the orbit.

        Words 0&1 = [INT32] till apoapse (unit s)
        Words 2&3 = [INT32] till periapse (unit s)
        Words 4&5 = [INT32] till ascending node (unit s)
        Words 6&7 = [INT32] till descending node (unit s)
        Words 8&9 = [INT32] orbital period (unit s)
        Words 10&11 = [INT32] current orbital speed (unit m/s)
        Words 12&13 = [INT32] current acceleration (unit m/s2)

    2 - COMPARE_ORBITS
        Gets two sets of [ORBITAL_STATE_VECTOR] from 24 word area of ram 
        starting at B and compares their orbits using current SOI as reference 
        frame. It returns inclination of orbit 1 relative to 2 in A and angle 
        between periapse 1 and 2 in B. Both are in angular format. This allows 
        one to compare orbits to plan intercepts and the like.

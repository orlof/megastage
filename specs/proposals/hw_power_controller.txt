DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
Name: UPCU 
(Universal Power Control Unit)
Version: 256
ID: 0xaff14367
Manufacturer: 0xE142A1FA (Ender Innovations)

Description:
	This is a central control unit that manages and watches the powerflow 
        throughout the ship. This system features a power priority system in 
        which latter hardware devices get power only after the preceeding 
        devices get fully powered. Devices in same priority level get power
        in unspecified order

	The priority list starts at 0 (highest priority) and ends at 65535 
        (lowest priority).

        WARNING: UCPU must be installed in ship power grid core and UCPU's
        generator control interface does not support multiple UCPUs in the
        same power grid. Results for plugging two controllers are not defined.

Interrupt behavior:

A - Behavior

0 - POLL_DEVICE Sets B to the state code, C to the error code.

	Status codes:
	0x0: generators inactive 
	0x1: generators active 
	
	Error codes:
	0x0: nominal
	0x1: underflow (power needs > power input)
	0x2: overflow (power input > power needs)
	0x3: OVERLOAD (power overflow > overflow tolerance)
	0xF: Unknown

1 - GET_POWER_FLUX 

    Sets B, C registers to information about power flux as defined 
    below:
	
    B: Total power production rate (Megawatts)
    C; Total power consumption rate (Megawatts)

2 - SET_PRIORITY 
    
    Sets the priority of hardware with pin B to priority level C.

    This DCPU is connected to pin 0xFFFF.

3 - GET_PRIORITY 

    Sets C to the priority of the device with hardware pin in B.

    This DCPU is connected to pin 0xFFFF.

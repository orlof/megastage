About: This device is the most basic, accurate, and least powerful of the 
current conventional space weaponry market.

It's damage is directly proportional to the power input and it's damage 
decreases linearly over very large distances. 

It has no penetration or electromagnetic damage, it is pure heat damage. 

Luckily it can make up for it's lack of penetration by the fact that one can 
input a LOT of energy to boost the damage through the roof.

Turret mount not included.

    Name: EIVD16
    (Ender Innovations Vector Display)
    Version: 16
    ID: 0x436d3335
    Manufacturer: 0xE142A1FA (Ender innov.)

About:
	This is a take on the Mackapar Media's Suspended Particle Exciter Display by Ender Innovations.
	Basically we took the idea of the SPED-3 and made our own vector display utilizing our 
	superior technology and intelligence to grant this humble display the Awesomeness* only Ender
	Innovations can bestow. This device reads a map of vectors from the ram in 2 words per vector
	and with a maximum of 256 vectors (2048 words maximum) and displays the map at 1 vector per
	millisecond (1000 vectors per second). This device also features a mappable 32 color palette 
	for it's vectors with 4096 possible colors per palette slot.
	Vector format:
	word 1 = xxxxxxxxyyyyyyyy
	word 2 = cccccXYZzzzzzzzz
	x = X coordinate, y = Y coordinate, z = Z coordinate, XYZ = signs of the coordinates, c = color palette index
	Palette format:
        0x0RGB

*Awesomeness patented by Ender Innovations.

INTERRUPT BEHAVIOR:

A - Behavior

0 - POLL_DEVICE Sets B and C to the latest status and error codes

	Status codes:
	0 - stand-by
	1 - active
	
	Error codes:
	0 - nominal
	1 - RAM exceeded
	F - Equipment malfunction
	
1 - MAP_VECTORS Starts rendering a set of vectors from RAM starting at B with number of vectors in C.

2 - MAP_PALETTE Memory maps the palette to RAM starting at B

3 - DUMP_PALETTE Dumps the default palette to RAM starting at B, halts the dcpu-16 for 32 cycles

4 - ROTATE_DISPLAY Takes a value from B in angular format and renders the display turned to that angle 
	(Default angle is 0 and angle is purely degrees, minutes are ignored.)

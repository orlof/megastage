DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: Model S8 Manouver Drive (engine)
    ID: 0xa8fb6730
    Version: 0xad3c
    Manufacturer: 0xe1e0bd31 (GENERAL DRIVES)

Description:
    Ships move through ordinary space using maneuver drives. Power for the S8MD
    is provided by the ship's power plant.

    S8MD feds hydrogen fuel into the ignition chamber and uses lasers to
    trigger a thermonuclear explosion to push the ship forward.

    Engine's power intake in safe operation area is from 0 to 992MW. Engine
    thrust is logarithmically proportional to the input power. Manufacturer's
    test data is available in separate data sheet.

    Engine is equipped with safety mechanism that protects against power
    intake failures. Engine's laser ignition system will not trigger the 
    reaction unless sufficient amount of energy is already reserved for 
    controlling the reaction energies. Insufficient power makes engine's
    power level to immediately drop to zero.

Interrupt behavior:
    When a HWI is received by the S8MD, it reads the A register and does one
    of the following actions:
    
    0: SET_POWER_LEVEL
       Reads the B register and sets the engine's power intake to B / 66.0 MW.
       If B is 0 or insufficient power is available, the safety circuit will
       immediately shutdown the engine. Powering the engine from shutdown
       state takes 20 to 60 seconds.

    1: GET_STATUS
       Engine's power level is set to B register.

    2: GET_ENGINE_ID
       ENGINE_ID is unique identifier for every installed engine within
       a ship. See ship's reference manual to deduct acceleration vector 
       for non-standard engine installations.

       ENGINE_ID is set to B register.
